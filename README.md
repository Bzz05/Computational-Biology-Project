# **Malaria Detection Using Deep Learning Models**

This repository contains code for detecting malaria from images using deep learning models. The project was developed as part of the Computational Biology lecture and involves training and evaluating several deep learning models on a malaria dataset.

### **Models Used**

The following models were implemented and evaluated:
- VGG19
- ResNet50
- InceptionV3
- Custom CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

### **Dataset Source**

Kaggle or download it from WHO website (The dataset contains images of parasitized and uninfected cells.)

### **Running on Kaggle**

Due to certain compatibility issues when running locally in Visual Studio Code (VSC) that prevent displaying final model metrics, it's recommended to run the project on Kaggle Notebooks for best performance and to avoid missing outputs.
